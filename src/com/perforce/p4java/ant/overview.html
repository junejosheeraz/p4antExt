The Perforce tasks implement Perforce commands using the Perforce Java
API. These tasks are intended for build automation with Ant.
<b>Note:</b>
These tasks are known to work with P4Java 2010.1, JDK 6 and Ant 1.7.0.
<p>The Perforce tasks also served as examples on how to use the
Perforce Java API. P4Java is a Java-native API for accessing Perforce
SCM services from within Java applications, servlets, plugins, and other
Java contexts.
<p>The Perforce task base class takes care of retrieving the
required settings for all Perforce tasks. For example, it retrieves the
Perforce port, client, user and password from the environment,
properties and attributes respectively. The base class also frames the
task execution and logs the execution output.
<p>The Perforce server specific base class uses the P4Java
ServerFactory class to obtain a IServer interface onto a specific
Perforce server at a known network address and port, and connects to
this Perforce server through the IServer interface that is returned from
the factory. It also logs in to the Perforce server through the
IServer's login and associated methods using the specified Perforce user
and password. To disconnect from a Perforce server, call the disconnect
method on the IServer interface.
<p>The Perforce client specific base class obtains a suitable
IClient interface into a Perforce client workspace through the IServer
interface's "get client" method.
<p>The following are some of the capabilities of the Perforce tasks:
<ul>
	<li>Get and processe lists of depot, client, and local files inthe
	Perforce client workspace, through the IServer and IClient interfaces.
	</li>
	<li>Add, edit, or delete files in the local Perforce client
	workspace using the IClient interface. These files are added to the
	default or a numbered Perforce changelist represented by one or more
	IChangeList interfaces, which are obtained through the IClient or
	IServer interfaces.</li>
	<li>Submit a specific changelist using the associated IChangeList
	interface. This submission can be linked with one or more Perforce
	jobs, represented by the IJob interface.</li>
	<li>Browse Perforce jobs and changelists, server side diffs of
	files, create labels, create tags, set counters, grep and revert files
	using the relevant IServer or IClient interfaces.</li>
	<li>Dump detail file info.</li>
	<li>Lock and unlock files.</li>
	<li>Shelve and unshelve files to and from the Perforce server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the individual tasks for details.
