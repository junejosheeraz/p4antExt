P4Ant installation instructions:

Prerequisites:

1. Perforce Java API 2010.1+
2. Perforce server 2005.2+
3. Apache Ant 1.7.0+
4. JDK 1.5.0+

Assumptions:

Since you are reading this document we assume you have done the following:

1. Downloaded the Perforce Ant tasks zip file from Perforce.
2. Unzipped the content into a directory (i.e. ${user.home}/p4ant).

Installation:

1. Create an Ant script as you would normally do.

2. Import the P4Ant tasks into your Ant script.

3. Add a P4Ant task to the Ant script's target.

4. Run the Ant script as you would normally do.

    Example:

    Create an Ant script (XML) named "p4ant-job.xml" with the following content.
    Replace the classpath of the P4Java and P4Ant JAR files with the path of
    your own PAnt tasks installation. Also, replace the variable values with
    your own Perforce settings. For examples, "port", "user", "passwd", etc.
